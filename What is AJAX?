AJAX is a set of Web development techniques using many Web technologies on the client side to create asynchronous Web 
applications. AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. AJAX is not a programming language. It uses a combination 
of a browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object and JavaScript and HTML DOM. AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously
by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This means it's possible to update parts of a web page, without 
reloading the whole page.
