Node.js was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009. Dahl goal was to make JavaScript, primarily a client-side language, run in back-end development. By 2010 Node had already become popular enough that the Node Package Manager, or NPM, was created in order to help people run, and pass on, Node based tools and libraries. Over the years, as programmers worldwide try to simplify their own lives, Node has become a major block in the “JavaScript Everywhere,” movement. This idea states that all web app development should revolve around the same coding language, rather than running something different server side.
